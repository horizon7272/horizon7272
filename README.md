# üëã Hello there ^-^
I am known as horizon72 online and I'm from Slovakia!<br><br>
I spend most of my time programming random stuff such as software and apps.<br><br>
You can contact me on Discord as <code>horizon72#5834</code> or check out my work in progress <a href="https://horizontek.000webhostapp.com/">website</a>.<br><br>
Alternatively, you can contact me on my email <code>horizon72@protonmail.com</code>.

## üõ†Ô∏è My work
I mostly work with Python, Java, HTML, CSS & JavaScript.<br><br>
I am an aspiring software engineer and front-end web developer, and am looking to actively improve at what I do.<br><br>
I am also working on a side project game called "Backrooms: The Arrival", with an obvious theme of the popular backrooms creepypasta.
